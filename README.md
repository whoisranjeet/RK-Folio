## üìß Contact Form Setup

This site uses **EmailJS** for the contact form. To set it up:

1. Create a free account at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
2. Get your **Service ID**, **Template ID**, and **Public Key**.
3. Update them in `main.min.js` (or your JS source if not minified):

   ```javascript
   emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");

   emailjs.send("YOUR_SERVICE_ID", "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID", {
     from_name: name,
     from_email: email,
     message: message,
   });
